                    Our project is the UEL, the Universal Energy Label. The purpose of this label is to show the consumer information on the production of products like what energy is used to create the projects and other information that matters. What we eventually want to do with that information is to create a comparison site similar to Kelley Blue Book in which we can explain what the product is, and what it does, and share that information on the site. What we need to do is find out how to implement a search engine on our site. How to create a comparison between items like how amazon compares products. And lastly, if possible, we can  make it so that other companies can list their products on our site and be able to check their numbers an energy.

Energy labelling was introduced by the EU in the 1990s. It helps consumers make a choice based on the relative energy efficiency, energy consumption, and performance of a product in typical operating conditions.
